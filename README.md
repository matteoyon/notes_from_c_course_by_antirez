# notes_from_c_course_by_antirez
This repo contains my personal notes from the C course that [@antirez](https://github.com/antirez) is publishing on his YouTube channel. Mind that Salvatore in person suggested to follow his course without ready material and learning by doing, but it's my desire to let this repo public, hoping that eventually it can be helpful to someone other than myself.
